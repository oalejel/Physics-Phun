# Physics-Phun

Physics Phun brings the phenomena of the real world to your pocket with motion, electricity, gas, and other physics simulations. Physics simulations help students better understand classroom content and feel more familiar with concepts that can be hard to grasp. 

Physics Phun was inspired by the work of the University of Colorado Boulder's Carl Weiman and his team on the innovative PhET simulator. Physics Phun will follow in their footsteps of teaching physics in a relatable way by expanding its number of simulations and open sourcing the application code on GitHub.
